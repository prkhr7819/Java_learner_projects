SMALL PROJECTS TO CLARIFY BIG CONCEPTS.
<br>
<br>
## Project.1) 
Randomising a number by computer and tring to guess the computer generated number using trial and error. Print greater if your guess is bigger than random number and vis-a-versa. Also print the number of tries took to guess the computer generated number
<br>
<br>
## Project.2)
Creating an array with user defined size and user input float values. Then perform following operations on it:-<br>&nbsp;1) Find sum and average.<br>&nbsp;2) Find a user given number in the array and return index.<br>&nbsp;3) Reverse the array<br>&nbsp;4) Find maximum and minimum in the array<br>&nbsp;5) Find if the new array is sorted or not and if sorted then ascending or descending.
<br>
<br>
## Project.3)
Initialising a string and then performing following operations on it:-<br>&nbsp;1) Convert al characters into lowercase.<br>&nbsp;2) Convert all spaces into underscores.<br>&nbsp;3) Replace the first word in the string to a variable.<br>&nbsp;4) Find if any double or triple spaces are present. if present then print its index and convert into single spaces.
## Project.4)
Creating a Rock, paper, Scissors game.
## Project.5)
Printing the multiplication table of a user input number with user input iterations also printing the sum of the multiplication table aswell.
## Project.6)
Print fibonnaci series using recursion concept.
## Project.7)
Take postfix notation as input and print the evaluation.
## Project.8)
Take array of candies with kids and extra candies as input. Then print "True" if extra candies can help the kid to now have max candies else print "false".
